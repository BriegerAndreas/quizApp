This JavaScript code implements a simple quiz application. Here's a summary of its functionality:

    Initialization:
      It initializes variables such as score, currentQuestionIndex, and questions. Each question in the questions array contains a question statement, an array of possible answers, and the index of the correct answer.
    displayQuestion Function:
      This function is responsible for displaying the current question and its answer choices. It updates the question text and dynamically creates buttons for each answer choice.
      Each button is associated with the checkAnswer function, which is triggered when the user selects an answer.
    checkAnswer Function:
      This function checks if the user-selected answer is correct by comparing it to the correct answer index stored in the questions array. If the answer is correct, it increments the score variable.
      Then, it updates the currentQuestionIndex and calls the displayQuestion function to show the next question.
    nextQuestion Function:
    This function simply increments the currentQuestionIndex and calls the displayQuestion function to display the next question.

Overall, this code provides the basic functionality for a quiz, allowing users to answer questions and see their score at the end.
